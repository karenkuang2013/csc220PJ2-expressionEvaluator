# csc220PJ2-expressionEvaluator
This project is a practice using stack. 
First I need to create my own Stack. Then I need to make use of the Stack I created to solve prefix evaluator problem.

- Use PJ2_Test.java to test correctness of your program

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):
	
  javac PJ2/*.java
  javac *.java

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run main() method tests in LispExpressionEvaluator and MyStack 
  java PJ2.MyStack
  java PJ2.LispExpressionEvaluator

  // Run main test program
  java PJ2_Test
